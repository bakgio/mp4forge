---

- Typed MP4 and ISOBMFF box model with registry-backed custom box support
- Low-level traversal, extraction, stringify, probe, and writer APIs
- Thin typed path-based helpers and byte-slice convenience wrappers for common extraction, rewrite, and probe flows
- Fragmented top-level `sidx` analysis, planning, and rewrite APIs for supported layouts
- Feature-gated decryption APIs and a sync-only `decrypt` CLI for the supported protected MP4 families
- Built-in CLI for `decrypt`, `divide`, `dump`, `edit`, `extract`, `mux`, `probe`, and `psshdump`
- Shared-fixture coverage for regular MP4, fragmented MP4, encrypted init segments, QuickTime-style metadata cases, and derived real codec fixtures for additional codec-family coverage

## Installation

```toml
[dependencies]
mp4forge = "0.7.0"

# With optional features:
# mp4forge = { version = "0.7.0", features = ["async"] }
# mp4forge = { version = "0.7.0", features = ["decrypt"] }
# mp4forge = { version = "0.7.0", features = ["decrypt", "async"] }
# mp4forge = { version = "0.7.0", features = ["mux"] }
# mp4forge = { version = "0.7.0", features = ["mux", "async"] }
# mp4forge = { version = "0.7.0", features = ["serde"] }
```

Install the CLI from crates.io:

```sh
cargo install mp4forge --locked
```

Install the current checkout locally:

```sh
cargo install --path . --locked
```

The published crate includes both the library and the `mp4forge` binary from `src/bin/mp4forge.rs`.

## Feature Flags

`mp4forge` keeps the default dependency surface minimal and currently exposes these optional public
feature flags:

- `async`: enables the additive library-side async I/O surface for seekable readers and writers.
  This rollout is Tokio-based, expects a Tokio runtime in the caller, targets seekable
  `AsyncRead + AsyncSeek` and `AsyncWrite + AsyncSeek` inputs and outputs, supports normal
  multithreaded `tokio::spawn` usage for the supported library paths, and keeps the current CLI on
  the existing sync path.
- `decrypt`: enables the additive decryption input, progress, and support-matrix types that fix
  the public shape for the decryption surface while keeping the default build unchanged. The
  landed sync library path covers the Common Encryption family (`cenc`, `cens`, `cbc1`, `cbcs`),
  PIFF-triggered compatibility behavior, OMA DCF atom files and protected movie layouts, Marlin
  IPMP ACBC and ACGK OD-track movies, and the retained IAEC protected-movie path. When combined
  with `async`, it also enables the additive file-backed Tokio async decrypt companions, while the
  CLI remains on the synchronous path.
- `mux`: enables the additive mux task surface and the retained low-level helpers underneath it.
  The library path covers the narrow public `MuxRequest` model with repeated track specs plus
  optional `segment_duration` or `fragment_duration`, real `ftyp`/`moov`/`mdat` writing for sync
  callers, additive async real-container writing when combined with `async`, internal chunk and
  duration coordination on one mux event graph, the retained low-level seekable and progressive
  payload assembly helpers, and one-sample-at-a-time seekable or progressive readers that stay
  aligned with the same staged plan model. It also enables the sync-only `mux` CLI route for one
  output MP4 built from repeated path-first `--track` inputs.
- `serde`: derives `Serialize` and `Deserialize` for the reusable public report structs under
  `mp4forge::cli::probe` and `mp4forge::cli::dump`, along with their nested public codec-detail,
  media-characteristics, `FieldValue`, and `FourCc` data. This is intended for library-side report
  embedding and uses the Rust field names of those public structs; the CLI `-format` outputs keep
  their existing hand-authored JSON and YAML schemas.

## CLI

```text
USAGE: mp4forge COMMAND [ARGS]

COMMAND:
  decrypt      decrypt a protected MP4 file
  divide       split a fragmented MP4 into track playlists
  dump         display the MP4 box tree
  edit         rewrite selected boxes
  extract      extract raw boxes by type or path
  mux          merge one video track plus audio, text, and subtitle tracks into one MP4
  psshdump     summarize pssh boxes
  probe        summarize an MP4 file
```

`decrypt` is available when the crate is built with `--features decrypt`. The CLI stays
sync-only, accepts repeated `--key ID:KEY`, optional `--fragments-info FILE`, and optional
`--show-progress`, and reuses the same library decryption surface that backs the feature-gated
sync and async APIs.

`mux` is available when the crate is built with `--features mux`. The CLI route stays sync-only
and accepts repeated `--track` inputs, one required positional output path, and at most one of
`--segment_duration` or `--fragment_duration`. The current public `--track` grammar is path-first:
`PATH` imports one raw source or every supported track from one MP4 source, while
`PATH#video`, `PATH#audio`, `PATH#audio:N`, `PATH#text`, `PATH#text:N`, and `PATH#track:ID`
select one specific track from a containerized source. The landed path-only auto-detection
currently covers MP4, supported AVI audio streams plus H.263/JPEG/PNG/MPEG-4 Part 2/H.264/AVC1 video streams, supported
MPEG-PS MPEG audio streams plus MPEG-4 Part 2/H.264/H.265/VVC video streams, supported MPEG-TS
MPEG audio streams plus AC-3/E-AC-3 audio plus MPEG-4 Part 2/H.264/H.265/VVC video streams, AAC
ADTS, MP3, AC-3, E-AC-3, AC-4, AMR, AMR-WB, QCP voice audio, DTS core audio, AAC LATM, Dolby
TrueHD, leading-sync MHAS MPEG-H, IAMF, H.263 elementary video, MPEG-4 Part 2 elementary video,
H.264 Annex B, H.265 Annex B, VVC Annex B, IVF-backed AV1, IVF-backed VP8, IVF-backed VP9,
JPEG still images, PNG still images, WAVE/AIFF/AIFC PCM, native FLAC, Ogg-backed FLAC,
Ogg-backed Opus, Ogg-backed Vorbis, Ogg-backed Speex, Ogg-backed Theora, and CAF-backed ALAC.
Broader DTS-family
sample-entry variants remain supported through MP4 track import, and the broader demux-backed
path-only families continue to move over behind the same public shape.
MP4-track merges continue to cover the broader registered sample-entry families because they
preserve encoded sample-entry bytes from the source file, and mixed video/audio/text/subtitle jobs
retain imported handler names and languages on the real MP4 path. The matching sync and async
library entry points use the same `MuxRequest` surface, while the retained lower-level mux helpers
remain available separately when you need staged planning or payload-copy behavior without the
task-level request layer. The public `mp4forge::mux::sample_reader` helpers can also expose stable
text or subtitle track identity when you construct them with companion `MuxTrackConfig` values.

`divide` currently targets fragmented inputs with up to one video track from AVC, HEVC, Dolby
Vision on HEVC, AV1, VP8, or VP9 and one audio track from MP4A-based audio, Opus, AC-3,
E-AC-3, AC-4, ALAC, DTS-family entries, FLAC, IAMF, MPEG-H, or PCM, including encrypted wrappers
that preserve those original sample-entry formats. Subtitle and text tracks remain unsupported in
the current divide output model. Pass `-validate` when you want the same probe-driven layout
checks without creating any output files.

`dump` defaults to the existing human-readable tree view. Pass `-format json` or `-format yaml` for
deterministic structured tree export with stable `payload_fields` for supported boxes; `-full` and
`-a` still control when large raw or unsupported payloads expand beyond the default summary-oriented
view. Add repeatable `-path <box/path>` filters when you want text or structured output rooted at
only the matched parsed subtrees instead of the whole file.

`edit` keeps the existing global `tfdt` replacement and `-drop` behavior, and now also accepts
repeatable `-path` filters when you want `-base_media_decode_time` to target only matching parsed
box paths.

`psshdump` defaults to the existing human-readable protection summary. Pass `-format json` or
`-format yaml` for deterministic structured reports with box offsets, system IDs, KIDs, `Data`
bytes, and the legacy raw-box base64 payload. Add repeatable `-path <box/path>`, `-system-id
<uuid>`, or `-kid <uuid>` filters when you want text and structured reports to return only the
matching protection boxes.

`probe` defaults to structured JSON output. When the input carries parsed codec-configuration
boxes, the report now includes a nested `codec_details` object per track for families such as AVC,
HEVC, AV1, VP8/VP9, MP4A, Opus, AC-3, PCM, XML subtitles, text subtitles, and WebVTT. When sample
entries carry `btrt`, `colr`, `pasp`, or `fiel`, the richer CLI path also emits nested
`media_characteristics` data such as declared bitrate, colorimetry, pixel aspect ratio, and
field-order hints. Pass `-detail light` for a lighter-weight probe that skips per-sample,
per-chunk, bitrate, and IDR aggregation, or use `mp4forge::probe::ProbeOptions` from the library
when you need the same control programmatically.
